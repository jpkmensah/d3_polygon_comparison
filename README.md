Compare Attributes Using Overlaid Polygons in D3

I'm learning D3.js and wanted to give comparisons a shot using polygons. An example of polygons used for comparison is the typical RPG stat polygon. You see a number of numeric metrics that a given entity can be evaluated upon. This project allows for the generation of polygons based on any number or attributes or metrics. These polygons may be overlaid for head to head comparisons. The values generated are random but feel free to update as data requires!
